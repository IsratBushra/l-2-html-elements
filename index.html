    <p><B>hello</B> is a salutation or greeting in the English language. It is first attested in writing from 1826.[1]
    </p>
    <p>Hello, <I>with that spelling</I>, was used in publications in the U.S. as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of
        the Norwich Courier of Norwich, Connecticut.[1] Another early use was an 1833 American book called The Sketches
        and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee,[2] which was reprinted that same year in The
        London Literary Gazette.[3] The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.[4]</p>
