    <h2>How BMARPC started </h2>
    <P>BMARPC stands for Birshreshtha Munshi Abdur Rouf Public College, a renowned institution in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It was initially established in 1984 as Bangladesh Rifles High School, primarily to provide education to the children of Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) members. The institution was later upgraded to a public college in 1994 and renamed after the national hero, Lance Nayek Munshi Abdur Rouf, in 2011.</P>
